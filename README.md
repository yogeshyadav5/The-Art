# Inroduction

This project is  Nft-Marketplace. Where everyone can sell their hand made art, digital art, videos, gif, audio and so many things in the form of nft.

We name this project The-Art because Art is an expression of our thoughts, emotions, intuitions, and desires, but it is even more personal than that: itâ€™s about sharing the way we experience the world, which for many is an extension of personality. We think that anyone can express their view in the form of picture and video and etc. And everyone has a different and unique view.
